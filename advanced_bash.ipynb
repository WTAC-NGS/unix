    "## Repeating analysis with loops\n",
    "It is common in Bioinformatics to run the same analysis on many files. Suppose we had a script that ran one type of analysis, and wanted to repeat the same analysis on 100 different files. It would be tedious, and error-prone, to write the same command 100 times. Instead we can use a loop. As an example, we will just run the Unix command `wc` on each file but instead, in reality this would be a script that runs in-depth analysis.  We can run `wc` on each of the files in the directory `loop_files/` with the following command."
