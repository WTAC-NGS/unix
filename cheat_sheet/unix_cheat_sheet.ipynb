    "\n",
    "* Always have a quick look at files with `less` or `head` to double check their format\n",
    "* Watch out for data in headers and that you don't accidentally grep some if you don't want them\n",
    "* Watch out for spaces, especially if you're using awk; if in doubt, use `-F\"\\t\"`\n",
    "* Regular expressions are wierd, build them up slowly bit by bit\n",
    "* If you did something smart but can't remember what it was, try typing `history` and it might have a record\n",
    "* `man the_name_of_a_command` often gives you help\n",
    "* Google is normally better at giving examples (prioritise stackoverflow.com results, they're normally good)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Build commands slowly\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted me to calculate the sum of all of the scores for genes on contig-1 in a bed file, I'd probably run each of the following commands before moving onto the next:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "head -20 bar.bed # check which column is which and if there are any headers\n",
    "head -20 bar.bed | awk '{print $5}' # have a look at the scores\n",
    "awk '{print $1}' bar.bed | sort -u | less # check the contigs don't look wierd\n",
    "awk '{print $4}' bar.bed | sort -u | less # check the genes don't look wierd\n",
    "awk '$4 ~ /gene-/' bar.bed | head -20 # check that I can spot genes\n",
    "awk '($1 == \"contig-1\" && $4 ~ /gene-/)' bar.bed | head -20 # check I can find genes on contig-1\n",
    "head -20 bar.bed | awk '($1 == \"contig-1\" && $4 ~ /gene-/) {sum+=$5}; END {print sum}' # check my maths\n",
    "awk '($1 == \"contig-1\" && $4 ~ /gene-/) {sum+=$5}; END {print sum}' bar.bed # get the answer you actually want\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Which tool should I use?\n",
    "\n",
    "You should probably use awk if:\n",
    "* your data has columns\n",
    "* you need to do simple maths\n",
    "\n",
    "You should probable use grep if:\n",
    "* you're looking for files which contain some specific text (e.g. `grep -r foo bar/`: look in all the files in `bar/` for any with the word 'foo')\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use find if:\n",
    "* you know something about a file (like it's name or creation date) but not where it is\n",
    "* you want a list of all the files in a subdirectory and its subdirectories etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should write a script if:\n",
    "* your code doesn't fit on one line\n",
    "* it's doing something you might want to do again in 3 months\n",
    "* you want someone else to be able to do it without asking loads of questions\n",
    "* you're doing something sensitive (e.g. deleting loads of files)\n",
    "* you're doing something lots of times\n",
    "\n",
    "You should probably use less or head:\n",
    "* always, you should always use less or head to check intermediary steps in your analysis\n"
